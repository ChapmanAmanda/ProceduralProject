# Procedural Project
Problem statement:
The goal of this project is to create a maintainable Android application that runs smoothly and can be built upon in time.
The boundaries of this project include the language, the options include Java and Kotlin. 
The IDEs are limited as well, with a choice between Android Studio or Eclipse. 
Constraints for this project include limited knowledge of programming language, familiarity with Android Studio, JDK being used,
a six week time limit, and  availability to access Android Studio (can't be installed on school computers).
To be successful in this goal the project needs to work, be user friendly, and get a grade of B or higher. 
Some assumptions about making this project are that an Android phone will be available to test the app,
that Android Studio is accessible everywhere, and that somebody with Andoid Studio knowledge will always be around to help.
Stakeholders in this project include myself, Professor Vanselow, and potential employers. 
The timeline I have created and hope to stick to, by week:
1. Install IDE, watch Android Studio tutorial videos, come up with and finalize project idea
2. Learn the Android basics, continue tutorial videos including user input, whiteboard project, psuedocode
3. Tutorial videos including multi-screen apps, work on psuedocode, start to code, get help
4. Tutorial videos including networking, code, watch videos on importing data
5. Tutorial videos including data storage, code, seek help to look over/improve code, run tests
6. Finish code, test app, run tests using other people, seek help in improving code, turn in
