# Procedural Project 
Problem statement: 
The goal of this project is to create an application that runs smoothly and can be built upon in time. 
The boundaries of this project include the language, it has to be done in C++.  
The IDEs are limited as well, with a choice between Visual Studio and cLion.  
Constraints for this project include limited knowledge of programming language, familiarity with IDE, 
a six week time limit, and PSI requirements. 
To be successful in this goal the project needs to work, be user friendly, and get a grade of B or higher. 
Stakeholders in this project include myself, Professor Vanselow, and potential employers. 

The timeline I have created and hope to stick to, by week: 

1. Install IDE, watch C++ tutorial videos, learn C++ basics, code, meet requirements for Sprint 1 Backlog (SBL) - Basic Output 

2. Continue learning C++ whiteboard project, pseudocode, code, meet requirements for Sprint 2 Backlog (SBL) - Conditions, Loops, Functions, Files intro.  

3. Tutorial videos, work on pseudocode, code, get help, meet requirements for Sprint 3 - Arrays and Vectors, Searching and Sorting 

4. Tutorial videos, code, meet requirements for Sprint 4 - Pointers, Characters, Strings, Recursion 

5. Tutorial videos, code, seek help to look over/improve code, run tests, meet requirements for Sprint 5 - Data Structures, Structs, Files

6. Finish code, test app, run tests using other people, seek help in improving code, meet requirements for Sprint 6 - Quality Analysis turn in 

This weeks productivity: 
1. Output production statistics such as total number of items produced and number of items of each type. 
2. Clear all warnings from Inspect Code. 
3. Format code using standard style guidelines. 
4. Enhance documentation: 
    Javadoc style comments for Doxygen 
    Comments in code 
    README 
5. Create animated gif of program running 
In addition, I improved the flow of the project as suggested   
changed to passing structures by reference and using pointers   
statistics now keeps updated count of item types, instead of starting back at 1 each time  
improved commenting and javadoc style comments for doxygen 
cleared (almost) all warnings, one remaining right now
updated displayProductionStatistics to display total number of items produced and items of each type
improved createPassword function to check passwords with less code
