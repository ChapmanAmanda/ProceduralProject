# Procedural Project 
Problem statement: 
The goal of this project is to create an application that runs smoothly and can be built upon in time. 
The boundaries of this project include the language, it has to be done in C++.  
The IDEs are limited as well, with a choice between Visual Studio and cLion.  
Constraints for this project include limited knowledge of programming language, familiarity with IDE, 
a six week time limit, and PSI requirements. 
To be successful in this goal the project needs to work, be user friendly, and get a grade of B or higher. 
Stakeholders in this project include myself, Professor Vanselow, and potential employers. 

The timeline I have created and hope to stick to, by week: 

1. Install IDE, watch C++ tutorial videos, learn C++ basics, code, meet requirements for Sprint 1 Backlog (SBL) - Basic Output 

2. Continue learning C++ whiteboard project, pseudocode, code, meet requirements for Sprint 2 Backlog (SBL) - Conditions, Loops, Functions, Files intro.  

3. Tutorial videos, work on pseudocode, code, get help, meet requirements for Sprint 3 - Arrays and Vectors, Searching and Sorting 

4. Tutorial videos, code, meet requirements for Sprint 4 - Pointers, Characters, Strings, Recursion 

5. Tutorial videos, code, seek help to look over/improve code, run tests, meet requirements for Sprint 5 - Data Structures, Structs, Files

6. Finish code, test app, run tests using other people, seek help in improving code, meet requirements for Sprint 6 - Quality Analysis turn in 

Time Log: 
Spent 4+ hours on sprint 4
Changes made:
Create an Employee account. 
Allow user to input full name in format FirstName LastName.  
Generate user id, which is their first initial and surname in all lowercase 
Allow user to input a password for the user  
The password must contain at least one digit, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one uppercase letter. The password cannot contain a space or any other symbols.  
Use a recursive function to encrypt the password.
