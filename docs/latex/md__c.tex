Problem statement\+: The goal of this project is to create an application that runs smoothly and can be built upon in time. The boundaries of this project include the language, it has to be done in C++.

The I\+D\+Es are limited as well, with a choice between Visual Studio and c\+Lion.

Constraints for this project include limited knowledge of programming language, familiarity with I\+DE, a six week time limit, and P\+SI requirements. To be successful in this goal the project needs to work, be user friendly, and get a grade of B or higher. Stakeholders in this project include myself, Professor Vanselow, and potential employers.

The timeline I have created and hope to stick to, by week\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Install I\+DE, watch C++ tutorial videos, learn C++ basics, code, meet requirements for Sprint 1 Backlog (S\+BL) -\/ Basic Output
\item Continue learning C++ whiteboard project, pseudocode, code, meet requirements for Sprint 2 Backlog (S\+BL) -\/ Conditions, Loops, Functions, Files intro.
\item Tutorial videos, work on pseudocode, code, get help, meet requirements for Sprint 3 -\/ Arrays and Vectors, Searching and Sorting
\item Tutorial videos, code, meet requirements for Sprint 4 -\/ Pointers, Characters, Strings, Recursion
\item Tutorial videos, code, seek help to look over/improve code, run tests, meet requirements for Sprint 5 -\/ Data Structures, Structs, Files
\item Finish code, test app, run tests using other people, seek help in improving code, meet requirements for Sprint 6 -\/ Quality Analysis turn in
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

This weeks productivity\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Output production statistics such as total number of items produced and number of items of each type.
\item Clear all warnings from Inspect Code.
\item Format code using standard style guidelines.
\item Enhance documentation\+: Javadoc style comments for Doxygen Comments in code R\+E\+A\+D\+ME
\item Create animated gif of program running In addition, I improved the flow of the project as suggested
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

changed to passing structures by reference and using pointers

statistics now keeps updated count of item types, instead of starting back at 1 each time

improved commenting and javadoc style comments for doxygen cleared (almost) all warnings, one remaining right now updated display\+Production\+Statistics to display total number of items produced and items of each type improved create\+Password function to check passwords with less code
